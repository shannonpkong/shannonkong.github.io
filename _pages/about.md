I am a PhD student in Psychology at Oxford Brookes University in the [Oxford Brookes Babylab](https://babylab.brookes.ac.uk/) working with Dr Nayeli Gonzalez-Gomez. My research interests include the development of word learning heuristics in monolingual and bilingual infants and toddlers. Previously I worked as a Postgraduate Research Assistant on ["The effects of social distancing policies on children's language development, sleep and executive functions"](https://babylab.brookes.ac.uk/research/social-distancing-and-development) project.
